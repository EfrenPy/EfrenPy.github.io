This talk at the 15th Pisa Meeting on Advanced Detectors introduces the development of a new silicon vertex detector for the LHCb Upgrade II, focusing on its design to handle increased data output rates, radiation levels, and occupancies. Emphasis is placed on the implementation of 4D hybrid pixel detector technologies, aiming for improved timing precision essential for vertexing in next-generation detectors. The presentation covers initial simulations, beam test results, and design optimizations for enhanced performance and durability.
