The presentation covers the upgraded LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO) detector's design and operational aspects, highlighting its enhanced track reconstruction capabilities under higher occupancy conditions. It delves into the cooling system, sensor design, and challenges posed by the extreme environment, including radiation damage. Initial results from the first year of operation assessing radiation impact and detector performance are also discussed.
