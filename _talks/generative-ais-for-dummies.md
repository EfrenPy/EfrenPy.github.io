The session aims to demystify the complexities of Generative AIs and showcase their practical applications in academic research. Through interactive examples and hands-on activities, participants will explore the capabilities of platforms like ChatGPT in text generation, image creation, and programming assistance.

This workshop is an excellent opportunity for both senior researchers and PhD students with no prior experience in AI to learn about and engage with generative AI technologies. Special attention will be given to their utility in simplifying research tasks and boosting productivity.

For PhD students interested in GitHub Copilot, we recommend registering with your USC email for access to additional tools. Assistance with registration will be provided at the workshop.
