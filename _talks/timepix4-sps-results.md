Presented at the 18th "Trento" Workshop on Advanced Silicon Radiation Detectors, this talk showcases the implementation and initial results of a beam telescope utilizing Timepix4 ASICs for enhanced synchronous readout, track reconstruction, and timing performance. The telescope's design, featuring eight planes with varying sensor thicknesses for spatial and temporal measurement optimization, and its cooling system are highlighted. Initial findings on timing and spatial resolution under different operational conditions are discussed, alongside future enhancements.
