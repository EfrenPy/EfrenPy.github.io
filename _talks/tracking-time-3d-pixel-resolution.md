This poster at the 15th Pisa Meeting on Advanced Detectors presents the study of the timing resolution and Landau contribution in single cell 3D pixel cells. It highlights how 3D geometries, combined with a small cell approach, are ideal for precision timing trackers in high radiation environments. The study includes charge collection measurements in laboratory settings and extensive test-beam campaigns, providing insights into field uniformity, charge collection, and the impact of instrumentation on signal composition.
