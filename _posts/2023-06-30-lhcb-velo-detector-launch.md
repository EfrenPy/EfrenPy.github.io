**❓ Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?**

In pursuit of answers to some of the most profound questions in physics, our researchers from the Instituto Galego de Física de Altas Enerxías (IGFAE), including Edgar Lemos Cid, Antonio Fernández Prieto, and Efrén Rodríguez Rodríguez, embarked on a significant mission to CERN. Their objective: to install and commission the new VELO detector for the LHCb experiment, marking a pivotal moment in the journey towards understanding our cosmos.

This Tuesday, July 5th, marks a momentous occasion as the VELO detector goes live with the commencement of #LHCRun3 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) following an extensive period of enhancements and upgrades. The VELO detector, a result of IGFAE's dedication since 2008, stands at the forefront of technological advancement in particle physics. Designed to measure b mesons with unparalleled precision, this detector is a critical tool in our quest to explore physics beyond the Standard Model.

The IGFAE's involvement in the design and development of the VELO subdetector sensors underscores our commitment to pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery. As we stand on the brink of potentially groundbreaking insights into the imbalance between matter and antimatter, we celebrate the ingenuity and perseverance of our team.

This milestone not only signifies a leap forward in our understanding of the universe but also exemplifies the collaborative spirit that drives the global scientific community towards unraveling the mysteries that lie at the heart of existence.
