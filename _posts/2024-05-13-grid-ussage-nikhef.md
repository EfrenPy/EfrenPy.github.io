 💻 **Unveiling the Potential in Academic Research!** 💻

🎉 Guess who's been keeping the grid busy? 🎉

That's right, I managed to snag the 3rd place in grid usage at Nikhef for my timing analysis of the Timepix4 telescope! 🚀

With over 185,849 jobs, I might have given the grid a bit of a workout. Maybe it's time to get it a gym membership? 😂

Big shoutout to my amazing team and colleagues for all the support and fun along the way. Here's to more data crunching and less grid hogging in the future! 🖥️🔬
