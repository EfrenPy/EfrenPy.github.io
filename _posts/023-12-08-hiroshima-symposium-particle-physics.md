ðŸŒŒ **Exploring the Frontiers of Particle Physics at the Hiroshima Symposium** ðŸŒŒ

Today marked a significant milestone in my journey through the realms of particle physics, as I had the privilege of presenting at the esteemed "Hiroshima" Symposium on the Development and Application of Semiconductor Tracking Detectors, held in Vancouver, Canada.

The focus of my presentation was the LHCb VELO detector, a marvel of modern physics and engineering that stands at the forefront of advanced pixel detector technology. The VELO detector is instrumental in pushing the boundaries of impact parameter resolution and tracking capabilities, particularly in the challenging conditions presented by high-luminosity environments.

The insights I shared today delve into the intricate details of the detector's design and functionality, highlighting its pivotal role in the LHCb experiment's quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe. It's an honor to contribute to this groundbreaking work in particle physics, advancing our understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter.

This symposium not only provided a platform to showcase the innovative developments in semiconductor tracking detectors but also fostered a vibrant exchange of ideas among leading scientists in the field. I am immensely proud to be part of this dynamic community, driving forward the frontiers of science and technology.
