ðŸš€ **Embarking on a New Journey with CERNâ€™s VELO Group** ðŸš€

As of October, Iâ€™ve officially embarked on an exciting new chapter in my career as part of the VELO (Vertex Locator) group at CERN, where I am thrilled to contribute to pioneering research and cutting-edge technologies. The VELO detector is a vital component of the LHCb experiment, and Iâ€™ll be playing a central role in advancing its performance and capabilities.

My current work focuses on several key projects, including the **simulation of 3D column silicon sensors** for the VELO, the **development of the Timepix4 telescope**, and creating **innovative testing techniques for high-energy physics sensors**. These projects are at the intersection of particle physics, sensor technology, and data analysis, and they promise to push the boundaries of what is possible in our understanding of the universe.

The Timepix4 telescope is one of the highlights of my work. This sophisticated tool will provide unparalleled precision in detecting particles, contributing to our ongoing efforts to improve sensor accuracy and performance. Leading test beam campaigns, ensuring smooth operations, and overseeing its construction are some of the responsibilities Iâ€™m excited to tackle. Additionally, Iâ€™m working on refining **data analysis techniques** that will enhance the overall output of experiments at CERN.

Joining the VELO group has been a thrilling challenge. Every day presents an opportunity to dive deeper into complex simulations, test new ideas, and collaborate with brilliant minds across CERN and the global physics community. Itâ€™s a truly unique environment where technology and science come together to break new ground.

As I look ahead, Iâ€™m filled with excitement for the discoveries to come, not only in terms of particle physics but also in the development of technologies that will support these scientific advancements. The future is bright, and I am proud to contribute to shaping it.
