# Abstract
The proven potential of 3D geometries at higher than 10^16 n·eq/cm^2 radiation fluences, combined with a small cell approach, makes them an excellent choice for a combined precision timing tracker. This study presents preliminary results on the timing resolution of a single 50×50μm^2 3D pixel cell through charge collection measurements with discrete electronics in a laboratory setup. In a test-beam campaign with 160 GeV SPS pions, a detailed timing, field, and efficiency map is presented using a multi-plane timing telescope with an integrated pixelated matrix. Another testbeam campaign was completed with the EUDET telescope to study field uniformity, Landau contribution, collected charge, and incidence angles of +/−12°, achieving a preliminary 5μm spatial resolution through MIMOSA CMOS tracking at CERN SPS pion beams.
