## Project Overview

**Role:** Project Lead | **Duration:** 2022-Present | **Organization:** CERN/Nikhef

### The Challenge

Design and build a particle tracking telescope capable of sub-100 picosecond timing resolution for validating next-generation detectors at particle beam facilities.

### My Contribution

- Led a team of researchers across 2 institutions (CERN, Nikhef)
- Designed 8-plane detector configuration with optimized sensor placement
- Developed Python-based data acquisition and analysis pipeline
- Implemented cooling system achieving stable -30°C operation
- Coordinated test beam campaigns at CERN SPS facility

### Technical Stack

`Python` `ROOT` `C++` `Git` `Data Analysis` `Hardware Integration` `Cryogenics`

### Results

- **90 ps** timing resolution achieved (world-class performance)
- System operational for multiple test-beam campaigns
- Results published at international conferences (Hiroshima Symposium)
- Framework adopted for testing future detector prototypes

### Industry Relevance

This project demonstrates skills directly applicable to:
- **Project Management:** Coordinating international teams and resources
- **System Integration:** Combining hardware, software, and infrastructure
- **Data Engineering:** Processing TB-scale datasets with quick turnaround
- **Problem Solving:** Optimizing complex multi-variable systems
