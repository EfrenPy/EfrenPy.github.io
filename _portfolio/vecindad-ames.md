## Project Overview

**Role:** Developer | **Type:** Personal Project | [Website](https://bertamirans.efrenrodriguezrodriguez.com/)

### The Challenge

Give residents of Ames (Galicia, Spain) a digital tool to propose, track, and vote on community initiatives — replacing scattered WhatsApp groups and paper petitions with transparent, structured civic participation.

### Solution

A progressive web app built around three participatory pillars:

- **Citizen Listening** — Community assemblies and shared diagnosis: structured input from residents surfaced in a public feed
- **Co-Design Workshops** — Collaborative sessions between residents and municipal staff, documented with progress tracking
- **Open Metrics** — Transparent publication of participation data and budget allocations
- **Active Projects** — Safe pedestrian route mapping (lighting audits + path proposals) and dog park improvement petitions with adhesion tracking
- **Multilingual** — Spanish, Galician, and English interfaces
- **Accessibility** — Dark mode, high-contrast toggle, PWA installable, responsive

Additional features: contact form, FAQ, downloadable participation guide (PDF), social sharing (WhatsApp, X, Facebook), email newsletter, and Schema.org structured data.
