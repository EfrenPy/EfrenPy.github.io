## Project Overview

**Role:** PhD Researcher & Electronics Developer | **Duration:** 2019-2024 | **Scale:** Multi-million EUR international project

### The Challenge

Upgrade the LHCb vertex detector (VELO) to handle 5x higher data rates and operate in an extreme radiation environment, while maintaining precision tracking capabilities.

### My Contribution

- Designed and characterized high-speed data transmission lines (5 Gbps/channel)
- Developed high-voltage flat cables rated for 1000V operation
- Performed quality assurance testing on 1000+ electronic components
- Participated in detector commissioning at CERN
- Contributed to integration and installation procedures

### Technical Stack

`Electronics Design` `LabVIEW` `VHDL` `Quality Assurance` `Python` `ROOT`

### Results

- Detector successfully launched and operational since 2023
- Data transmission reliability >99.9%
- All components passed radiation hardness requirements
- Contributing to LHCb's physics program studying matter-antimatter asymmetry

### Industry Relevance

Skills directly applicable to:
- **Electronics R&D:** High-speed signal design and characterization
- **Quality Engineering:** Systematic testing and validation procedures
- **Large-scale Projects:** Working within complex organizational structures
- **Technical Documentation:** Creating procedures for international teams
